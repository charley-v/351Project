The programming language I used was C++.

To run program:
1. Download files
2. Open two terminal windows where files are located
3. On one of the terminal windows type 'make'
4. now it is ready to send and receive
5. On one terminal window type "./sender keyfile.txt"
6. On the other terminal window type "./recv"
7. The file was succesfully sent.

I solo'd the project.
